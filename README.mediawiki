<pre>
python library/python-midi-master/setup.py install
</pre>


Midi write function is working. Run:

<pre>
python testMidiWrite.py
</pre>

It will generate a midi file which plays "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"


Midi read function is working. Run:

<pre>
python testMidiRead.py
</pre>

It will read in midis/FurElise.mid , change all C notes to C#, and write the
results song to midis/FurEliseWeird.mid . As a result, "Fur Elise" is changed
from A minor to A major.

Scraped 1,700 classical music from midiworld.com. You can see them in:
<pre>
midis\midiworld\classic\
</pre>
If you are interested, the code that downloaded these files is in:
<pre>
scrape\
</pre>
But you will need to install [http://lxml.de/ lxml] and [http://scrapy.org/ scrapy] to run it.
