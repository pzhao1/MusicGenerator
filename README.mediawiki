Peng: Found a library for processing midi in Python. To install, run:

<pre>
python library/python-midi-master/setup.py install
</pre>


Peng: midi write function is working. Run:

<pre>
python testMidiWrite.py
</pre>

It will generate a midi file which plays "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"


Peng: midi read function is working. Run:

<pre>
python testMidiRead.py
</pre>

It will read in midis/FurElise.mid , change all C notes to C#, and write the
results song to midis/FurEliseWeird.mid . As a result, "Fur Elise" is changed
from A minor to A major.
