Peng: Found a library for processing midi in Python. To install, run:

<pre>
python library/python-midi-master/setup.py install
</pre>


Peng: midi write function is working. Run:

<pre>
python testMidiWrite.py
</pre>

It will generate a midi file which plays "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"


Peng: midi read function is working. Run:

<pre>
python testMidiRead.py
</pre>

It will read in midis/FurElise.mid , change all C notes to C#, and write the
results song to midis/FurEliseWeird.mid . As a result, "Fur Elise" is changed
from A minor to A major.

Peng: I scraped 1,700 classical music from midiworld.com. You can see them in
the midis\midiworld\classic\ directory.

The code that downloaded these files is in the scrape\ directory if you are 
interested. But you will need to install lxml and scrapy to run it.
